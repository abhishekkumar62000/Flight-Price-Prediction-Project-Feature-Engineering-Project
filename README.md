Flight Price Prediction Project
Project Overview
Today, I embarked on an exciting journey to develop a Flight Price Prediction Project, aimed at forecasting airfares using advanced machine learning techniques. The project leverages feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.

Objectives

To analyze various factors influencing flight prices.
To create a robust predictive model that can estimate airfare based on historical data.
To implement effective feature engineering strategies to improve model performance.
Data Collection
The first step involved gathering a comprehensive dataset, which includes:

Flight details (departure and arrival airports)
Dates of travel
Historical flight prices
Airlines and their respective characteristics
Additional factors such as seasonality and time of day
Feature Engineering Process

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from duplicates and missing values.
Date Features: Extracting useful features like day of the week, month, and holiday indicators.
Airline Encoding: Converting categorical airline data into numerical format for analysis.
Distance Calculation: Calculating the distance between departure and arrival airports to understand pricing trends.
Seasonality Factors: Incorporating seasonal trends that affect flight prices, such as summer vacations and holiday travel.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Through EDA, I visualized relationships between different features and flight prices, revealing significant patterns. This included:

Price trends over time
The impact of day of the week on pricing
Differences in prices among various airlines
Model Selection
After preparing the features, I selected several machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Model Training and Evaluation
The models were trained using a portion of the dataset, with the remaining data reserved for testing. Key evaluation metrics included:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared values to measure model fit
Conclusion
This Flight Price Prediction Project not only highlights the importance of feature engineering in machine learning but also provides valuable insights into factors influencing flight prices. The potential applications of this project can benefit travelers seeking the best fares, airlines in optimizing pricing strategies, and travel agencies in providing better recommendations.

Future Work
Further improvements can be made by incorporating more granular data, exploring additional features like customer preferences, and using deep learning techniques for enhanced predictions.
